# Ignores

Just me playing around with Go. I'm very much a beginner.

I threw this together to see if I could, to learn a bit about how Go works, and
to see if I could go faster than a Node.js app.

## Usage

``` sh
git clone git://github.com/github/gitignore
go build ignores.go
ignores gitignore
```

Then visit http://localhost:8080/ to see some JSON, and `GET /{lang}` to see the
corresponding gitignore inside the `github/gitignore` repo.
